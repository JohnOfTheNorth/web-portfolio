        <!-- About me section -->
        <p>
          After graduating high school, I decided to take time off from going to
          college to try to understand what I would like to achieve in life. It
          took longer than expected to choose a career path that stood out to
          me. Initially, I wanted to go to college to become a veterinarian,
          however, in my first semester back in college, after nearly 5 years
          hiatus I took an intro to python course. Afterwards, I realized the
          beauty of coding and it's power of creation. The creation of a fully
          functioning program from nothing was an extremely satisfying feeling.
          It was then that I came to the decision to try and pursue a career in
          this field! As I was completing my Associate's Degree in Bergen
          Community College, a few of my friends had informed me about the
          Thinkful Software Engineeing bootcamp, and the services it provided.
          Although it has been a difficult journey to this point I am glad that
          I found a career path that I enjoy working towards, while working with
          others!
